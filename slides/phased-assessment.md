# Phased Assessments
---


# tl;dr

<em>Break assessments into "phased" or "staged" deliverables, rather than a single, large submission point</em>

<!--
So what do we mean by 'Phased' or 'Staged' assessments. Essentially its taking what might otherwise be a large assessment with a single (typically end of module) submission and breaking it down into multiple staged deliverables. 

These deliverables can either be summatively marked and contribute to an overall assessment grade, or formatively reviewed to enable iterative development towards the final submission point.

# Benefits

- Eliminates a single point of failure
- Provides 'actionable' feedback
- Improves final results and progression rates
- Distributes workload without over-assessing
- Applicable to most assessment types
- Flexible implementation

<!--
Why do this?

The key reason is to remove a single point of failure. Large 100% assessments with a single submission point give students a single opportunity to succeed at a point where there may be limited opportunity to rectify and issues... e.g they've left it too late and cannot complete everything that is required or they've not done as well as expected and now its the end of the module with now scope to improve. 

This feeds into the next point regarding actionable feedback. With a single submission point students get feedback that will critique their work and tell them what can be improved, yet this comes at a stage where it cannot be actioned. Of course it can be actioned in future modules where similar skills are deployed, but for the current piece of work there is now means to apply the feedback afforded. With staged assessments feedback can be given incrementally allowing the student to see where they are going wrong before its too late

This then helps improve final results and progression rates. In creative computing last year 100% of the students who started in level 4 progressed to the next level of study. Every module in L4 utilises staged assessments in some form. The concern with deploying this approach is students may be overwhelmed with the number of submissions, yet based on last years evidence the opposite occurred. This could just be a fluke and be down to other factors including who is in the cohort, yet even from this years evidence ~90% of students are keeping up with the multiple submissions

Part of the success comes from distributing the students workload over the course of a semester. We all know that students will inevitably leave work until the last minute, therefore having a single submission point would mean they are leaving a lot until the last minute and likely suffer the consequences as a result. Staged deadlines force students to evenly distribute the work across the semester and break the work into smaller chunks. This can also be useful for splitting larger or more complex briefs into more manageable or easier to digest tasks, which in turn addresses critieria on many students access plans. 

The phased approach can be applied to most assessment types and is used in a variety of forms within computing including 'single' artefact development, portfolio assessments and also research or essay based assessments. This is afforded by flexible ways the approach can be implemented including using formative feedback at each phase and a summative mark at the end (but with summative penalties for missed deadlines) or summative marks at each phase contributing towards the final mark.

# Problems addressed

- First year students without assessment experience
- Procrastination and poor time management
- Knowledge and skills that take time and practice to develop, which are all necessary for summative coursework
- Inconsistent attendance

<!-- 
What problems does this approach address

For first year students it helps ease them into university and developing experience with the assessment process. The phased approach typically means they will have an assessment due much earlier that they would otherwise. Therefore they encounter the expectations earlier and can learn from mistakes much earlier and hopefully before its too late.

Due to the distributed workload phased assessments help with poor time management. As already noted students typically leave things to last minute or will only focus on a single deadline at a time. Phased assessments force students to chunk up the assessment and work on it incrementally over the course of the module, more in line with our expectations of how they work

Critically the phased approach also helps ensure students are developing the core skills they need in a timely manner. Within computing many of the skills we expect students to have take time to develop and build from a previous understanding of content taught earlier in the module. The phased approach ensures students are building the required skills before they move onto move complex topics. As tutors it also helps us identify those who might be struggling and need extra support before its too late. In certain instances it also makes sure students have completed certain objectives that are required for the next set of material, for example they've developed a user registration system for their website before taught content on authenticating user posts is delivered so they can make the connections

Inconsistent attendance - Dave what do you mean here?

# Two general approaches

<div class="row">

<div class="col">

## Formative deliverables

- Interim deliverables
- Formatively marked with opportunity for correction
- Penalty for late submission at each stage
- Final deliverable concludes the assessment - no further correction allowed

</div>

<div class="col">

## Summative deliverables
 - All deliverables marked summatively
 - Late submissions capped at 40%
 - Each submission contributes towards overall assessment mark
 - The final deliverable concludes the assessment

</div>
</div>

# Examples

## Formative with mark penalties

- Ideation & UX Design
- Creative Web

## Summative at each stage

- CodeLab
- Digital Storytelling
- Digital Visual Design

<!--
In terms of how this is deployed in computing here are a few examples

Formative with mark penalites (e.g. they have staged submission points and get formative feedback at each stage with a summative mark given at the end of the module. However there are mark penalties for missing a submission point).

Ideation - Ensures iterative development and allows students to improve their work before the deadline as per the benefits of the iterative design cycle

Creative Web - ensures students have foundational functionality for their projects before new features and techniques are introduced

Summative at each stage (e.g. each submission point is marked and contributes to the final assessment mark)

- CodeLab breaks the assessment down into manageable chunks to afford time management. Allows tutors to spot students who are struggling and address misunderstanding before more complex techniques are introduced. Allows students to identify common mistakes, misconceptions and address these in the next submission rather than maintaining bad habits throughout

- Digital Storytelling and Digital Visual Design are both portfolio assessments which consist of several smaller briefs. The phased approach again helps manage time, breaks the assessment into smaller more managable tasks and provides actionable feedback students can take forward into the next assessment.

# Key Points

- Ensures students understand what is expected
    - Umbrella assessment brief
    - Micro briefs for specific tasks
    - Discuss in class
- Provide feedback after each deliverable
    - Formative if resubmission allowed
- Don't let the total workload increase


<!--
In summary this approach enables students to understand what is expected, to address issues before a single point of failure and break down complex assessments into smaller tasks

Feedback offered after each stage provides actions to improve work and this can be either summative or formative in how its applied.

Whilst the number of deadlines increases for the students it is important to ensure the overall level of work is not increased
